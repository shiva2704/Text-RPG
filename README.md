# Text-RPG
A game made for fun and to develop my skills in Front-End Development.
I have made this game with insipiration from Free-Code-Camp while learning from one of their courses. This Project helped in easy understarding of JavaScript Basics.
I will definetely further update this Game with a lot more features in future as my knowledge on handling javascript, html and css improves.
